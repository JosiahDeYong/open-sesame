Research
--------
- Research special characters. (See link above in Questions)
- Research how to make an alert pop up.
- How do I check the user entered length? (Hint: use conditional)
- How do I use Math.random() to pick a random letter?
- How to randomly select from a specific group of characters? (e.g. upper vs lower)

Steps
-----

DECLARE VARS
string password (the result)
num passLength (user input)
bool useUpper (user input)
bool useLower (user input)
bool useSpecial (user input)
bool useNumber (user input)
arr lowerChars
arr upperChars
arr specialChars
arr numChars
arr choices (array containing all characters chosen by the user)

PROMPT user for password length

CONFIRM if user would like lower case
IF user would like lower case
THEN add all lowerChars to choices

CONFIRM if user would like upper case

CONFIRM if user would like special characters

CONFIRM if user would like numbers
